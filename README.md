# 🏟️ Gameday Stats

**Gameday Stats** is a full-stack web application built with **Django** that provides live football (soccer) data — including fixtures, scores, standings, and player statistics — for the **top five European leagues**:  
**Premier League**, **La Liga**, **Serie A**, **Bundesliga**, and **Ligue 1**.

This project was developed as the **Final Project** for **CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (CS50W)**.

---

##  Overview

Gameday Stats enables football fans to keep up with ongoing seasons through real-time data fetched
from multiple APIs. The project integrates **two data providers** — **API-Football** and **Football-Data.org** — and automatically updates results, fixtures, and player statistics via **GitHub Actions** (used instead of Celery due to hosting limitations on Render).

---

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
Gameday Stats is different from the other projects in this course because it focuses on real-time sports data and brings together several technologies to make that possible. Instead of simply storing user input like a to-do list or social network, this project connects to live football data APIs and updates its database automatically. It’s designed to feel like a real sports tracking platform, where users can see fixtures, scores, standings, and player stats across major European leagues — something far more dynamic than the earlier projects in the course.

One thing that makes this project more complex is the amount of data it handles and how that data is kept up to date. Rather than manually entering information, the app fetches data from two APIs, processes it, and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. It also uses GitHub Actions to automatically update the site on a schedule, so the information stays fresh without me having to run commands myself. This was challenging to set up, especially when figuring out how to make different services work together in a deployed environment.

Finally, this project shows a full understanding of what goes into creating and maintaining a complete web application — from backend logic and database design to front-end presentation and automation. It was built from scratch and not based on any previous assignment. Each part — the models, API integration, data updates, and interface — was written and connected by me. Overall, Gameday Stats combines everything I learned throughout the course into one cohesive and functional app, showing both distinctiveness and real-world complexity.

I decided to build Gameday Stats because I’m a big football fan and wanted a personal project that connects my interest in the sport with what I’ve learned in web development. This made it more engaging to build and helped me understand how professional sports platforms manage and update real-time data.

## 🧠 How It Works

Gameday Stats integrates **two football APIs** and uses **Github Actions** to automatically update data on a schedule.

| Function | Data Source | Update Method |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Fixtures & Live Scores | **API-Football** | Periodically updated |
| Player & Team Stats | **API-Football** | Fetched on demand or scheduled |
| League Standings | **Football-Data.org** | Updated daily |
| Historical Data | **Football-Data.org** | Optional background fetch |
  

---

## 🔁 Automated Data Updates (Github Actions)

Since Redis and Celery aren’t available on Render’s free plan, GitHub Actions are configured to automatically:

- Run scheduled manage.py commands
- Fetch latest fixtures, standings, and player stats
- Commit changes or trigger webhooks if needed

This ensures Gameday Stats remains up-to-date even after deployment.
